Have a look at #specification.md. Your first task is to create a specific exam task consisting of at least 5 main subtasks. Extend the #specification.md accordingly. Write everything in hungarian and translate the original content of the specification into hungarian as well.

---

Modify #specification.md at every subtask to include instructions on where (for example in which project) the subtask should be implemented. The tasks should be clear and concise, with a focus on practical implementation.

---

By the time of the exam, students are not expected to know about dependency injection, so do not include it in the tasks. Also remove complex date manipulation tasks. Instead of those, you can assign tasks related to regular expressions.
Please update the #specification.md accordingly.
