I am using Moodle at university courses. The "Project laboratory" course is taken by many students (around 500 each semester) and all of them have to choose a topic supervised by an advisor colleague.

I need Moodle to support the following functions:
- Every staff member should be able to publish topics with title and description, and the maximal number of students allowed to enroll to the topic.
- All students have to choose a topic (exactly one) to work on.

# Documentation and grading

- Students have to submit a documentation of their work at the end of the semester. They have to upload a document and a pptx presentation as well.
- At the end of the semester, supervisors assign grades to the students based on their work.
- I want to be able to export the grades of all students at once.

# End-of-term presentations

- At the end of the semester, every student has to present their work as a presentation.
- Presentations are organized into sessions.
- Max. 9 students can register into a session.
- Sessions have a title.
- Two staff members have to register for every session as the committee.
- The committee has to be able to write comments and assign a score to every student during the presentation.
- The result (score and comment) of every student should be visible for the student's advisor (advisor of their chosen topic).

# Nice-to-have features - peer review

- If possible, I want students to be able to assign scores and comments to the other presentations inside their session.
- I want students to be able to assign a score to all their peer reviews so that they can mark them "useful" or "neutral" or "useless". This is to detect useless peer reviews.
