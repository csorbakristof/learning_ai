# DLFUSION Feature Implementation

## Overview

The DLFUSION feature successfully combines data from DLXLS (BME topic data) and DLNEP (Neptun enrollment data) into a unified JSON dataset, according to the specification requirements.

## Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Data Loading
- **DLXLS Data**: Loads student topic information from `data/bme_topic_data.xlsx`
- **DLNEP Data**: Loads student enrollment information from multiple Excel files in `data/neptun_downloads/`
- **Smart File Processing**: Automatically extracts course codes from filenames and handles empty files
- **Course Filtering**: Only processes data for specified course codes from the specification (21 allowed courses)

### ‚úÖ Data Fusion Logic
According to specification requirements:
- **Course Code Filtering**: Only includes students enrolled in the specified list of 21 course codes
- **Student Identification**: Uses Neptun codes as primary keys
- **Course Enrollment**: Collects all courses each student is enrolled in (identified by BMEVI* course codes)
- **Topic Information**: Links students who have topics with their supervisor names and categories
- **English/Hungarian Detection**: Correctly identifies English vs Hungarian courses and topics
- **Complete Dataset**: Includes students with topics only, enrollments only, or both
- **Validation Warnings**: Reports missing course data for comprehensive coverage tracking

### ‚úÖ Output Format
- **JSON Structure**: Saves fused data in JSON format as specified
- **Metadata**: Includes creation date, statistics, and source record counts
- **Student Records**: Each student record contains:
  - Student Neptun code and name
  - List of enrolled courses with details
  - Topic information (if available): supervisor, category, title

## File Structure

```
app1_data_collector/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dlfusion_processor.py          # Main DLFUSION implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_dlfusion.py               # Standalone test script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_dlfusion_integration.py   # Integration test with prerequisites check
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                        # Updated to include DLFUSION in workflow
```

## Usage

### Method 1: Standalone Testing
```bash
cd app1_data_collector
python test_dlfusion.py
```

### Method 2: Integration Testing
```bash
cd app1_data_collector
python test_dlfusion_integration.py
```

### Method 3: Through Main Application
```python
from dlfusion_processor import DataFusionProcessor

processor = DataFusionProcessor()
success = processor.process_fusion()
```

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Successful Test Run
- **Total Students**: 221 students in fused dataset
- **Students with Topics**: 10 students (from DLXLS)
- **Students with Enrollments**: 213 students (from DLNEP)
- **Students with Both**: 2 students (overlap between datasets)
- **Unique Courses**: 6 BMEVI courses identified
- **Topic Categories**: 2 categories found (Nincs megadva, Szoftver)

### üìä Data Sources
- **DLXLS Records**: 10 source records processed
- **DLNEP Records**: 213 source records from 6 files processed
- **Output File**: `data/fused_student_data.json` (3,492 lines)

## Key Advantages

1. **No Re-collection Required**: Works with existing DLXLS and DLNEP data files
2. **Specification Compliant**: Follows all requirements for student identification and data combination
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Handles missing files, empty datasets, and data inconsistencies
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
5. **Rich Statistics**: Provides detailed fusion statistics and summaries
6. **JSON Format**: Output in JSON format as specified for further processing

## Sample Output Structure

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "creation_date": "2025-07-28T23:46:09.259872",
    "total_students": 221,
    "students_with_topics": 10,
    "students_with_enrollments": 213,
    "dlxls_records": 10,
    "dlnep_records": 213
  },
  "students": [
    {
      "student_neptun": "TEUL0U",
      "student_name": "Ajkler √Åkos Szabolcs",
      "enrolled_courses": [
        {
          "course_code": "BMEVIAUAL05",
          "schedule_type": "nan",
          "entry": "Nem",
          "partial_result": "nan"
        }
      ],
      "has_topic": false,
      "supervisor": null,
      "topic_category": null,
      "topic_title": null
    }
  ]
}
```

## Integration with Main Application

The DLFUSION feature is now integrated into the main data collector workflow and will automatically run after DLXLS and DLNEP collection, providing a complete data fusion solution for project laboratory session planning.

## Next Steps

The fused JSON data is ready for use in the MKXLSX feature (Excel table creation for session planning) and can be used by the Web Automator application for automated session creation.
